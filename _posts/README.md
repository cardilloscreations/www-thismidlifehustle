# Notes on Video Log Posts

A collection of reminders when creating new posts.

## Reminders

- [Post file naming is specific](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/ "Jekyll Documentation") (e.g., 2023-01-01-how-to-write-a-post.md).
- Copy and paste the full YouTube description for convenience.
- Remove the CHAPTERS block because that's only needed by YouTube.
- Add <> around links because I've enabled kramdown markdown processing.
- Be sure to use "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━" because that's used to mark the excerpt.
- Fix the excerpt section if needed (e.g., playlist links, etc).
- Use the `embed-responsive` classes for the YouTube `iframe`.


## Resources

- **/assets/** - contains any additional images or resources that are being hosted and served for the post.
- **/assets/images/vlog/** - contains the post header image and I will name them after the post so they're consistent.
- **embedded** - most posts will also have a YouTube video embedded but will not be hosted here.
